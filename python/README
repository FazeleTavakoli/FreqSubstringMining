INSTRUCTIONS
------------


You need to install the python mmh3 package to run this code https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mmh3/2.0. On ubuntu you can run 'sudo pip install murmurhash3'

In a directory on your laptop 

git clone https://github.com/FazeleTavakoli/FreqSubstringMining.git
cd FreqSubstringMining/python/
rm bloom.pickle
python freqSubStrMin.py sequential-data.txt 1000

This outputs everything on console, and not to a file. The file bloom.pickle is the pre-created bloom file. You can delete it and the code will re-generate it again. Takes around 3 minutes on my computer using 3 cores.
