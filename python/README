You need to install the python mmh3 package to run this code https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mmh3/2.0.

After git clone:

cd python/
python freqSubStrMin.py sequential-data.txt 1000

This outputs everything on console, and not to a file. The file bloom.pickle is the pre-created bloom file. You can delete it and the code will re-generate it again. Takes around 10 minutes on my computer.
